This is sabotage, an experimental distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

Requirements:
- ~4G free disk space
- root access
- usual GCC 4 toolchain
- git
- a bootloader of your choice (extlinux is favored)
- lots of time and a fair bit of Linux knowledge

This system has been built on up-to-date Gentoo, Exherbo and Arch systems.

READ THE COOKBOOK FIRST.

Build instructions:  Caveat emptor, this is all pre-alpha!
DO NOT RUN SCRIPTS YOU HAVE NOT READ.

% cp KEEP/config.stage0 config
% vi config
  $A  architecture (x86_64 or i386)
  $K  directory with patches
  $S  where sources are compiled (stage0: ~700MB, stage1: ~2.1GB)
  $R  root file system

% . ./config       # required!

% ./build-stage0   # build toolchain (~15min on a modern machine)
% ./enter-chroot   # enter $R chrooted, needs root password
# cd /tmp/src/sabotage   # absolute path required!
# mk stage1        # rebuild stuff, build kernel (~1h)
copy $R to a ext4 file-system
# extlinux -i $R/boot

# mk pkg           # additional stuff
# mk xorg          # build X.org

See "mk help" for further options.

The build is parallel-safe (MAKEFLAGS=-j<N>), but all packages are build
sequentially.

The default root password is "sabotage".
